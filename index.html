          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.
        </h2>

        <p>
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            What can I say about this film? It’s as close to perfect as any film
            I’ve seen, from any genre. The relationship between Eli and Oskar is
            so beautiful, so pure. So many of us can relate to Oskar’s story. To
            watch it unfold feels personal and painful, possibly because it taps
            into so many of our own experiences from childhood, when we felt
            powerless, alone, and misunderstood. Oskar and Eli meet at the
            perfect moment. Both have been alienated by their circumstances, and
            both desperately desire connection and love. The fact that Eli
            happens to be a vampire is somewhat moot (until the end of the film,
            of course). It’s what happens because she’s a vampire that is so
            important to their connection. The book that the film was based is
            also quite good, and, as is typically the case, goes much deeper
            into each characters’ backstory. We learn so much more about Eli’s
            origins (e.g. Eli is actually a boy that was castrated, which the
            film hints at in one particular scene), as well as many other
            characters (such as Håkan, Eli’s caretaker, who was a pedophile that
            created a sort of symbiotic relationship with Eli where he would
            find blood for her and she would… ?). I can’t tell you how many
            times I’ve seen this film (and forced others to watch it with me),
            and save for the cat attack scene (which some say was intentionally
            humorous, but feels like too much of a momentary shift in tone to
            me), it’s just as beautiful and impactful today as the day it was
            released. Strong recommend.
